  # Number of hosts to run the benchmark on
#   num_hosts: [4, 3, 2, 1]

  # When using RStream this is the number of "slots" in the hostfile (sources
  # and sinks are added automatically).
  # In Flink and MPI it's the number of slots assigned to each worker.

  # You can add more hyperparameters here!

  # Example: an MPI/OpenMP implementation may spawn "threads_per_proc" threads
  # for each process, taking this parameter as command line argument. You can
  # use, for example, `-T {threads_per_proc}` as extra arguments to tell the
  # program how many threads it is allowed to use.
